Tic Tac Toe
===========
There are two implementations of this exercise: Java and Android.

* [Java Implementation](#java-implementation)
* [Android Implementation](#android-implementation)

## Java implementation
The Java implementation is located inside the `tictactoe-java` folder.

The objective of the pure Java implementation are:
*. Develop models of the game
*. Develop logic to determine the next move for best outcome
*. Develop logic to determine if there is a winner for a game

Once you build and run it, it is fully automated until it reaches either of the following three states: 
*. You win 
*. You lose
*. Tie
